## 2024-05-22 - GlobalScope in Worker Helpers **Learning:** Helper classes used by `CoroutineWorker` (like `LibraryUpdateNotifier`) sometimes use `GlobalScope` to "fire and forget" UI updates, but this decouples the work from the Worker's lifecycle. Making these helpers `suspend` ensures the Worker stays alive until notifications are processed. **Action:** When refactoring helpers called by Workers, prefer `suspend` functions over `GlobalScope` to bind execution to the Worker's `doWork` scope.
